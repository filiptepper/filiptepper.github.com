__UPDATE__

Due to many issues with Apple APIs I've decided to pull EasyPivot off the
App Store. Sorry for the inconvenience.

First attempt and already a success! Personal for sure. Finally got my act together and released a piece of native Mac OS X software.

[EasyPivot](http://easypivot.filiptepper.com/ "EasyPivot") is a very simple single purpose application. At the office
I'm using an external display which I can pivot. I'm not a huge fan of going through the whole process using System
Preferences just to change the resolution. I really don't like the Applescript either. So why not write a small
utility than can handle this for me? Hence the EasyPivot.

Hope you guys enjoy it, right now it's only $0.99!
