        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Filip, and this is my <code>README</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to be working with you!</p>
<h3 id="you--i">You &amp; I</h3>
<p>Every week we will have a 1:1. During this time I don&rsquo;t expect project updates, this time is all about you. I will be giving you feedback, asking you for feedback, learning more about your goals, and most importantly - hearing how I can help you become the best you at <em>$COMPANY</em>. If you can&rsquo;t do your job I  need to know. If you have thoughts about your career I need to know too. I&rsquo;m here to help.</p>
<p>As we start working together I ask you some very basic questions, like how do you prefer to get your feedback, or what made you pick the offer from <em>$COMPANY</em>. I want to know you better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in continuous feedback. If I notice something you can expect to hear from me almost immediately. If you notice something - don&rsquo;t wait until our 1:1, let me know that you want to talk. The small things are important too.</p>
<p>I never say &ldquo;we need to talk&rdquo; and then schedule a surprise meeting. This is the scariest thing to hear at work.</p>
<p>I consider Slack to be asynchronous communication. I would encourage you to disable notifications and make sure to prioritize uninterrupted work. This goes both ways - I&rsquo;m doing my best to be available but I need an uninterrupted focus time too. I might call you, but only if it&rsquo;s a business-threatening situation.</p>
<p>You are never expected to work on the weekends, and I very much recommend removing all work-related apps from your phone (unless agreed otherwise). The only exceptions are PagerDuty and other on-call enabling software.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong> are the expert. I will be asking questions that may seem obvious to you but will help me understand the context better. I work for you.</p>
<p>I expect you to read the docs and plan your work thoroughly. I don&rsquo;t like being surprised mid-project by something that could have been avoided. If you need more time to prepare - let me know. When <em>$COMPANY</em> was at a very early people have been taking a lot of decisions that led to acquiring some deliberate technical debt. But your goal is to stay one step ahead, plan things, review with the team and get their buy-in before committing to a solution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty serious person, so feel free to tell me to relax and remind me that we should be having fun too!</p>
<h3 id="me">Me</h3>
<p>I live in Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>I have 2 kids and I will often use them as an excuse for being AFK.</p>
<p>In my office, you&rsquo;ll notice guitars &amp; books. Besides that, you can hear me mention cycling and volleyball. And some nerdy stuff.</p>
<p>I am an introvert. Our first interaction will be awkward - I&rsquo;m a really shy person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working across multiple time zones for the better part of the last 10 years and I will always prefer overcommunication over lack of visibility. But please let me know if you think it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>My personal goal is to disappear and for you to not even notice.</p>
